-- ASSIGNMENT 2 SCRIPT 4:

USE pradojciassign2db;

-- Delete all doctors that got their license before Jan 1, 1965.
-- Note: this command causes an intended error since at least one doctor exists that is referenced in 
--   another table as a foreign key, due to a lack of ON DELETE CASCADE used in this table.
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE licedate < '1965-01-01';
-- Result: nothing can be removed unless you remove from the hospital specifically referencing that doctor.

-- Create a viewÂ showing patient first/last names treated by hospital head doctors, made heads after Dec 31, 1995, and the doctor's last name and hospital name. 
CREATE VIEW file4view AS SELECT patient.fname, patient.lname, doctor.lname AS "doctorname", hospname FROM patient, doctor JOIN hospital WHERE licenumb IN (SELECT headdoclicenumb FROM hospital WHERE headdocstartdate > '1995-12-31') AND licenumb = headdoclicenumb AND ohip IN (SELECT patientohip FROM patientdoctor WHERE doclicenumb = licenumb);

-- Prove that the view works by selected all rows from it.
SELECT * FROM file4view;

-- Show all data from the doctor and patientdoctor table.
SELECT * FROM doctor;
SELECT * FROM patientdoctor;

-- Delete doctor 'Clooney' from the table.
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE lname = 'Clooney';

-- Show the doctors table to prove the previous command was successful.
SELECT * FROM doctor;

-- Show what the cascade did to the patientdoctor table.
SHOW CREATE TABLE patientdoctor;

-- Show all the rows of the doctor table.
SELECT * FROM doctor;

-- Delete all the Surgeons from the doctor table.
DELETE FROM doctor WHERE specialty = 'Surgeon';
-- Result: the delete command was unsuccessfull since doctor Aziz's ID is referenced as a foreign key in the hospital table
-- as it's head doctor. Therefore he can't be removed unless he is removed as head doctor. 
-- This is because the table was designed according to the ERD to always have a head doctor.
