# University-Assignments
University Assignments in multiple computer science courses.

Minor programs / Assignments written for university that are not considered Projects.

Disclaimer: some of these assignments have been written in minor part by Western University Computer Science Professors or TA's and I do not claim all credit on these files. However many are purely my work, and others are mostly all my work (credit given where is due). Additionally note that not all these assignments are perfectly done, so be advised if using them for inspiration.
