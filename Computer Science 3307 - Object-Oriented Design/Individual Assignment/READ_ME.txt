Hello,

I'm terribly sorry, but I realized late (after my 2nd 
installation of Raspberry Pi), that nothing compiles,
even a simple cout hello world. I plan on reinstalling 
and troubleshooting my Desktop Raspberry Pi, but for this 
assignment, I hope you will forgive me and be merciful if
my code doesn't fully compile, but is mostly sound.

Thank you for your patience and kindness.
